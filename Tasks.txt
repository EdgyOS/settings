NOTE: Currently for Gnome only.
To change that:
- Detect wether Gnome or Cinnamon
- Force round borders on Cinnamon so as native Gnome applications does
- Open cinnamon-settings if Cinnamon or gnome-control-center if Gnome

- floflis central icon
- display Floflis Central item in MoreSettings ONLY if Floflis detected
