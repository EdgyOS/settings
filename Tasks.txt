- rename "More Settings" to "Home", all all references and in i10n too
- copy "More Settings" tab, now as a last tab
- add "More Settings" heading to "Home" tab
- add overview widgets to "Home" tab

NOTE: Currently for Gnome only.
To change that:
- Detect wether Gnome or Cinnamon
- Force round borders on Cinnamon so as native Gnome applications does
